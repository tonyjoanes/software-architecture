Once a platform has been selected and development started it is reversible!!

Decisions are often emotional and developers will want to use the latest and greatest etc.

### Considerations

Can it perform the required tasks. Ensure the requirements can be met by the technology that you want to use.

Community, does it have one and what is the support like. Will you be able to get answers to questions for the technology choice that you have made. You can check on Stackoverflow for example, how many questions are being asked and answered.

Popularity, is it widely used? You can try looking up on Google trends to get any idea of its popularity and how much its being used and searched for.

### Frontend Technology

When selecting we want to use something with robust UX capability

#### Web

- Angular
	- Full blown framework
	- Long learning curve
- React
	- Library
	- Easy to learn and fast to get started with

#### Mobile applications

- Native
	- Native development platforms
	- IOS tools
	- Android developed with Java and android SDK
	- Multiple expertese required
	- Best user experience
- Hybrid
	- Development is regular web development
	- Thin native wrapper
	- Browser pages with native wrapper
	- Can be challenging to access device capabilities
	- PWA does enable better performance and device handling capabilities
- Cross Platform
	- Xamarin C#, specialised environment
	- React Native Javascript
	- Compiled at the end for different native environments
	- No need to know Java or Objective C
	- Gaps in supporting latest features of native capabilities
	- Doesn't support heavy graphics
	- Sometimes you have to resort to native languages to get specialised behaviours

#### Desktop

- Winforms
	- Limited, looks old now
	- Short learning curve is quite short
	- Runs on Windows PC
- WPF
	- Full control on visuals
	- Flexibility on the UI
	- You will need to learn XAML
	- Steap learning curve
- UWP
	- Universal windows platform
	- Unifies all windows screens
	- Quite similar to WPF
	- Runs in sandbox so doesn't have full access to underlying system
	- Long learning curve
	- Not mature
	- Not popular

#### Datastore

- SQL
	- Relational and the most traditional
	- Stores data in tables
	- Concrete and set columns
	- Requires migrations to change tables
	- Transactions for executing atomic sets of actions
		- Rollbacks
		- ACID
	- Querying using SQL, very popular and mature
	- SQL is fairly easy to read
- NoSQL
	- Performance
	- Scaleability
	- Schema less
		- Not enforced
		- JSON documents are flexible
		- Unstructured data storage
	- Transactions
		- Eventual consistency
		- System needs to be able to support temporary inconsistency
	- Each NoSQL requires learning its own querying language
